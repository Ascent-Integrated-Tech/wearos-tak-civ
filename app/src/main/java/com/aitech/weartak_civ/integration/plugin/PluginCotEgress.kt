/**
 * Offers CoT this watch is sending to plugins that asked for it.
 *
 * A plugin is another endpoint alongside TAK servers, SITX, companion BLE and multicast — with one
 * difference that shapes where this is called from: a plugin's transport may be the only one
 * available. A Meshtastic plugin on LoRa still works with no wifi, no cell, and no TAK server, which
 * is exactly the situation where the watch most needs to be heard.
 *
 * So this is invoked from [com.aitech.weartak_civ.service.CotDispatchService.dispatchOutgoingCot],
 * the common fan-out point, rather than from the transports beneath it. Hooking `sendDataTAKServers`
 * or `MulticastPublisher.send` would look equivalent but is not: both are conditional on their own
 * transport being up, so forwarding would silently stop precisely when the mesh matters most.
 *
 * Delivery is opt-in and always asynchronous, so a wedged plugin cannot stall the host's dispatch.
